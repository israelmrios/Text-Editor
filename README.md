## Description
This application is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) site that uses data persistance techniques. The application can be found in [Heroku](https://herokuapp.com/) but can also be cloned and run locally, see [Installation](#installation) and [Usage](#usage) for more details. This application was created to create notes or snippets with or without an internet connection and be able to  reliably retrieve them for later use.

This project has been the most complex we have been assigned as of yet. It was very challenging but great hands on practice setting up a PWA Application. I was able to practice implementing methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. Since I ran into many issues even uploading to Heroku I was able to really dive deep into this project.
